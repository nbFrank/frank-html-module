<h1>docxtemplater</h1>

<p><strong>docxtemplater</strong> is a library to generate docx/pptx documents from a docx/pptx template. It can replace {placeholders} with data and also supports loops and conditions. The templates can be edited by non-programmers, eg for example your clients.</p>

<p>Installation: <span style="background-color:lightGray">npm install docxtemplater</span></p>

<p>If you download the JS from there, you should use <span style="background-color:lightGray">new Docxgen()</span> instead of <span style="bacground-color:lightGray">new Docxtemplater()</span>, because I do not want to bring in a breaking change on a minor version change in the docxtemplater-build repository.</p>

npm install && npm run compile
